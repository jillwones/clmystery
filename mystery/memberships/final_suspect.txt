The final suspect is Jeremy Bowers, there were 4 membership cards found, so I used cat to concatenate those 4 membership files together, the-4-memberships.txt, I then did "cat the-four-memberships.txt | grep "<NAME OF SUSPECT>" | wc -l", both Jacqui and Jeremy showed up on 4 lines therefore both had memberships at all 4, but the suspect was a male therefore Jeremy Bowers is the only suspect that fits.
